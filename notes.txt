1. make a class for the mcp41010
2. Can we take the voltage across the R1 resistor and calculate current from that value?
3. Change the pin numbers in pin.h
4. Change the pin numbers in max1132.cpp
5. Do we need to use a voltage divider to measure the current? Probably yes, as the voltage will be from 0-10v.
